### Welcome to my GitHub ‚ú® 

My name is Summer and I am a Data Analyst in Rx Pricing & Underwriting at Walgreens! I currently work on Fee-for-Service Medicaid and Managed Medicaid.

I am a double alum of the University of Chicago. I finished my Master of Science in June 2024 in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (CAPP). Prior to my master's, I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy with a Specialization in Statistics in June 2023. You can view my (previous) resume [here](https://github.com/sumslong/sumslong/blob/main/resume/Long_Resume.pdf).

## Projects

- üèôÔ∏è Resources for New Arrivals (Spring 2024): A project in progress. Previously started as a project for CAPP 30235 - Software Engineering for Civic Tech, it was passed onto interns from my graduate program to finish.
- üìä [Visualizations to Word](https://github.com/sumslong/viz-to-word) (Summer 2023): During my internship at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, I created a executable for staff to automate the generation of 100+ visualizations per internal report and order them based on criteria chosen from a list designed in consultation with labor experts. This tool is still used on the team. 
- üõí [University of Chicago Buy & Sell](https://github.com/nikhilr5-uchi/MPCS51205_FinalProject) (Fall 2023): For MPCS 51205 - Topics in Software Engineering, I worked on a team to create an auction website for university students and faculty members. In this project, we deployed Docker containers for RabbitMQ for RPC to add items as well as created a user interface. This application has user authentication implemented.
- üíò [Matching Between Humans & Artificial Generation of the ‚ÄòPerfect Match‚Äô](https://github.com/rok12003/see-you-l8r-allidater): For CAPP 30255 - Advanced Machine Learning for Public Policy, I worked on a team to utilize data from users of OKCupid to match existing users together and fine-tune a GPT-2 mdoel to generate an ideal match based on user-submitted text. To prevent abuse of artificial intelligence, we deployed Detoxify to screen user-submitted text for generation as well as monitoring generation from our fine-tuned GPT-2 model. This application was built in Flask and demonstrated in our final presentation, in which our professor utilized the app.
- üìö [Accessibility and Usage of Libraries in Chicago](https://sumslong.github.io/library-usage/project/project.html) (Fall 2022): For CAPP 30239 - Data Visualization for Public Analysis, I cleaned and linked a variety of datasets of average household income, number of library visits, and number of computer sessions at a library. I created a webpage deployed with GitHub Pages with summary and interactive visualizations to allow for data exploration. I made data-driven conclusions about library accessibility and proposed supplemental ways to confirm my findings.
- ü§î [Sentiment Analysis of Tweets containing ‚ÄòObamacare‚Äô of ‚ÄòAffordable Care Act‚Äô](https://github.com/necabotheking/ml-affordable-care-act) (Spring 2023): For CAPP 30254 - Machine Learning for Public Policy, I worked on a team to build sentiment models from scratch on ~7 million Yelp reviews‚Äîleveraging star ratings and top n-grams. Then, we manually created a test set of human-identified sentiment on tweets and tested a variety of machine learning models to find the best-performing on our test set. We created a report analyzing sentiment based on factors such as date posted and term used to describe the policy.
- üìù Citation Network Analysis (Winter 2023): For MSCA 31013 - Big Data Platforms, I worked on a team to analyze an 18GB dataset of academic papers on GCP using PySpark. Removing duplicate papers and erroneously inputted information, we computed top categories by year, distribution of topic count, and the most common terms used in abstracts. We then built machine learning models to classify paper topics, predict the number of citations a paper would have, and define the intersections of fields over time. 
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶ [Optimizing Information to Improve Graduation Rates for Youth in Foster Care](https://sumslong.github.io/hsgrad/project.html) (Winter 2023): As a part of my undergraduate honors thesis, I created an interactive webpage with data from the National Youth in Transition Database. I provide background, examine whether the survey-based dataset is representative of the target population, and provide summary statistics about graduation rates for subsets of the surveyed population. 
- üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è [Medicare Opportunities](https://github.com/sumslong/big-data) (Spring 2022): For CMSC 12300 - Computer Science with Applications III, I worked on a team to create MapReduce programs that considered misalignment in our dataset due to non-comma separation. Then, we explored the number of services provided on average, what states had service deserts, and a variety of attributes about providers who accept Medicare. We took log-transformations when appropriate of our findings to enhance our analysis.
- ü´Ä [Heart Disease Risk Prediction, Mapping, and Recommendations](https://github.com/sumslong/cvd-project) (Winter 2022): For CMSC 12200 - Computer Science with Applications II, I worked on a team to create an application that would assess one's individual risk for heart disease. Using a 70,000 patient dataset, we trained a random forest model to predict risk of heart disease. Then, we scraped PubMed, Google Scholar, WebMD, and Mayo Clinic for relevant articles according to user-input terms. Using a user-input literacy level, we then computed a readability index to order the presentation of articles to a user.
