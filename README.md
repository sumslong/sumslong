### Welcome to my GitHub ✨ 

My README is currently in construction!

My name is Summer and I am a current graduate student at the [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program at the University of Chicago.

I am finishing my Master of Science in June 2024. Prior to my master's, I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy with a Specialization in Statistics at the University of Chicago in June 2023.

## Projects

- 🏙️ IN PROGRESS - Resources for New Arrivals (Spring 2024): A project in progress for CAPP 30235 - Software Engineering for Civic Tech.
- 📊 [Visualizations to Word](https://github.com/sumslong/viz-to-word) (Summer 2023): During my internship at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, I created a executable for staff to automate the generation of 100+ visualizations per internal report and order them based on criteria chosen from a list designed in consultation with labor experts. This tool is still used on the team. 
- 🛒 [University of Chicago Buy & Sell](https://github.com/nikhilr5-uchi/MPCS51205_FinalProject) (Fall 2023): For MPCS 51205 - Topics in Software Engineering, 
- 💘 [Matching Between Humans & Artificial Generation of the ‘Perfect Match’](https://github.com/rok12003/see-you-l8r-allidater): For CAPP 30255 - Advanced Machine Learning for Public Policy, 
- 📚 [Accessibility and Usage of Libraries in Chicago](https://sumslong.github.io/library-usage/project/project.html) (Fall 2022): For CAPP 30239 - Data Visualization for Public Analysis, 
- 🤔 [Sentiment Analysis of Tweets containing ‘Obamacare’ of ‘Affordable Care Act’](https://github.com/necabotheking/ml-affordable-care-act) (Spring 2023): For CAPP 30254 - Machine Learning for Public Policy 
- 📝 Citation Network Analysis (Winter 2023): For MSCA 31013 - Big Data Platforms
- 👨‍👩‍👦 [Optimizing Information to Improve Graduation Rates for Youth in Foster Care](https://sumslong.github.io/hsgrad/project.html) (Winter 2023): As a part of my undergraduate honors thesis, I created an interactive webpage with data from the National Youth in Transition Database. I provide background, examine whether the survey-based dataset is representative of the target population, and provide summary statistics about graduation rates for subsets of the surveyed population. 
- 👩‍⚕️ [Medicare Opportunities](https://github.com/sumslong/big-data) (Spring 2022): For CMSC 12300 - Computer Science with Applications III, 
- 🫀 [Heart Disease Risk Prediction, Mapping, and Recommendations](https://github.com/sumslong/cvd-project) (Winter 2022): For CMSC 12200 - Computer Science with Applications II,
